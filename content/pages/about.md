VerticalCue Design was established by John Vrbanac, a professional enterprise
software engineer, in response to the lack of quality custom software
services available to small businesses.  John felt that in the age of
outsourcing, the core concepts of <span style="color: #09F;">integrity</span>,
<span style="color: #09F;">ingenuity</span>, <span style="color: #09F;">quality
</span>, and <span style="color: #09F;">maintainability</span> have been
sacrificed for the sake of the bottom line. It is VerticalCue Design's vision
to provide a way for small businesses to have access to the best services
available at a reasonable price.
